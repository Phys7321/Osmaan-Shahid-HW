11.1
General comment: you should still put some "master file" in your folders so that I don't have to guess at what the input arguments are (though you are including comments which is always good) and interpret the outputs (which is your job).
Problem 1: Your function is outputing a NaN for the period, you should look into that. Graphs look good though
Problem 2: The outputs in the function definition don't match what I think you want to output. In this program, you're not taking full advantage of programming, you are repeating a lot of code and you are creating variables with different names that hold the same type of information - that's what creating an array is for. All these quantities should be arrays. The plots look good though.
Problem 3: Doesn't run
Will continue
11.2
Problem 4: I'd like to see more work on the calculation of the delta as a function of the driving frequency w
Problem 5: doesn't run for me. I do see you using arrays to store more of the parameters, now you should take the next step and use MATLAB array capabilities to eliminate unnecessary code.
Problem 6: Looks good, you just need to do problem 7 and the sinusodial initial conditions
12/10
Problem 1: Still output NaN for the period for me.
Problem 2: I see some good for loops going on - now starting to take advantage of the coding techniques that you should. 
Problem 3: Looks good 
Problem 4: I can see that you did a lot of work with the structures in this. Hopefully that was a fruitful exercise. Still missing the delta graphs though, and I get an error half way through because t3 is not defined.
Problem 5: I getting some errors about concatenation. Apparently, it doesn't like what you are doing with the ode solver in line 40
Problem 7: Not finished.
