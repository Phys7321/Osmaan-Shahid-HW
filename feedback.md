I think you still have a little work to do. I do like the color maps that your potential program produces (though there is a problem with the 3rd program, it doesn't run right now). I would look into numpy.quiver and numpy.grad for the electric field lines. 
oh and safe yourself and me some trouble in the future **don't put spaces in your program names!!**
