I think you still have a little work to do. I do like the color maps that your potential program produces (though there is a problem with the 3rd program, it doesn't run right now). I would look into numpy.quiver and numpy.grad for the electric field lines. 
oh and safe yourself and me some trouble in the future **don't put spaces in your program names!!**

Problem 3 HW 2 needs a look. Focus on what is in the denominator of you integral. You also have a float where an integer is needed.

Oh, it's been a while. Challenge problems 2 need some work. 2.4 works, but the rest are not completed or don't run. You have some undefined variables in there and problem 2.1 and 2.2 are not graphing what they are supposed to
Homework 2 is done, beautiful visualizations!!! And I'm happy that you are spending the time on comments
And I'm mostly happy with HW1, I'm assuming that you know how to run your python code from a command line, even though I need to import your file, find the HWp3 function, and run it myself.
